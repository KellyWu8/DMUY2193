# Reaction on Wireframing Article
My thoughts about this article are that wireframing is an essential part of the UX process. Having some blueprint will not only help with a deeper communication with the clients or team but also avoid making mistakes, which will result with you redesigning the whole website frequently. It is also efficient to create a wireframe early on so you can have a clear understanding of the problem, get different viewpoints of potential issues, test interaction with focus groups, and save time when finally building that website.
