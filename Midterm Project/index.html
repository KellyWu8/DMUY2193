          JAPAN Fes! This Japanese cultural festival held in New York City is an
          epic celebration that features a wide range of Japanese cultural
          elements, including traditional music and dance performances, Japanese
          food vendors offering a variety of Japanese dishes, cultural
          workshops, and opportunities to learn about Japanese arts and crafts.
          The biggest Japanese food festival in the world has been gathering
          over 250,000 people yearly and is held over 20 times a year with 750
          vendors.

          It was my first time at this food festival, so I didn't have much
          expectation besides a warning from a friend that it might be very
          crowded. They were right. Off the bat, when I got to the entrance of
          the festival, there were a bunch of people -- whether they were in
          line at a vendor or trying to shuffle their way down the street. It
          felt like I got 1 step per 10 seconds on the street with the more
          popular vendors. However, that didn't take away from the lively vibe
          of the festival with music blasting at the DJ set and the Japanese
          performances from the stage.

          The first vendor I went to was Premium Lobster Miso Ramen by Onisoba
          Fujiya. This vendor had a pretty long line, as I found out from their
          promoter guy (who I say deserves a raise as that man was going all out
          on his role and promoting that vendor for his life) that this vendor
          was a part of the ramen contest at the festival. The Premium Lobster
          Miso Ramen is the champion ramen of the Ramen Contest 2022 and is back
          to win their second consecutive championship. The ramen was in a small
          yellow bowl cup containing noodles, two slices of meat, a shrimp, and
          lobster soup.

          Another popular vendor was Karls Balls (very eye catching with its
          bright yellow banner and tent), which served takoyaki. The front of
          the vendor had a person cooking the takoyaki, so people could actually
          see how it was being made and what the cooking process of it was like.
          With juicy octopus inside, a special savory sauce, and with dancing
          bonito flakes, takoyaki is the most famous Japanese street food.

          As I walked down the street of the festival, I didn't realize how big
          the festival actually was. I tried to look down the street to see if
          there was a clear ending, but all I saw were more heads, tents, and
          flags. So, out of curiosity, I decided to walk all the way to the end
          just to see how far the festival goes. This is when I realized that
          there were not just flags of Japan but also a bunch of flags of the
          Philippines. There was a whole Philippines section at the festival,
          which had a lively karaoke tent. After this section, there was also a
          mix of other flags like Mexico, Columbia, and Jamacia. This festival
          not only had Japanese food but food from other cultures as well.

          Overall, the festival was pretty fun. I enjoyed most of the food even
          though all of them were veryyy overpriced. But the vibes were good.
          The DJ/MC did a great job hyping everyone at the festival with his
          enthusiasm and energy. And I really enjoyed the performances that
          showcased traditional Japanese dances and music. The food festival is
          something I would definitely go to again with friends and family
          during the weekends. Tip for future self or others is to maybe get
          there early, as the festival was very packed with a bunch of people.
          Also, there are no bathroom stalls around... so you need to figure
          that situation out before going to this event.
