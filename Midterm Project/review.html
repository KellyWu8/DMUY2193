            <b>Premium Lobster Miso Ramen</b>
            <br />
            Overall, the ramen was pretty good. The favors were there and
            everything. But, I would say the lobster soup was a bit too salty
            for me. That dropped it a star. Other than that, I can see why this
            vendor had one of the longest line.

            One of the best takoyaki I've ever had. Super flavorful. Made with
            fresh ingredients. And, overall, delicious -- a quality product that
            is definitely worth the wait.

            <br />
            The drink tasted like expected -- like any other brown sugar milk
            tea. Maybe a tad bit of too much sugar but I didn't really mind, as
            it still taste good.

            <b>Wagyu Beef Skewer</b>
            <br />
            Ok... where do I start off? First off, out of all the food I bought,
            this might be the most overpriced one. Around $20 for 1 skewer (4
            pieces). Basically, $5 per bite. Wallet was crying. Because it was
            so expensive, I expected to taste the best beef I've ever had in my
            life to make this purchase worth it. Unfortunately, it was mid at
            best. The wagyu melted in your mouth but the flavor just tasted like
            butter.

            <b>Matcha Mochi Croissant Cube</b>
            <br />
            The matcha and mochi tasted pretty good. The reason why I dropped
            the star was because the croissant was a brick. Because it was
            pre-baked and placed outside the for visuals (plus the cold
            weather), the croissant was not soft to bite into at all.

            You can't go wrong with tanghulu. The strawberry was very fresh and
            big with a light coating of sugar. A good way to end my trip at this
            festival.
