# Midterm Project Proposal

## Concept Theme
    I plan on creating a blog-and-review-like website about my experience at an upcoming food festival -- JAPAN Fes New York.

    I will have some commentary posts about this excursion.
    A review page with my star ratings of some of the foods.
    As well as lots of photos of the food there! ☜(ﾟヮﾟ☜)
